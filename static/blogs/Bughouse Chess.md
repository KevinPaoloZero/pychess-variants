Weâ€™re pleased to announce that Bughouse Chess, one of the most popular variants, is now available to play on Pychess!

This is the result of almost three years of relentless coding work by [@blunderman1](https://www.pychess.org/@/blunderman1)

Bughouse was requested on lichess from the very beginning [here](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/issues/50) and [here](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/issues/1628), but it was denied because "The long-term complexity is probably just not worth it". Lichess users never gave up though, they wrote several petitions and later created the [lichess-bughouse](https://lichess.org/team/lichess-bughouse) team as well. In light of this, it is impossible to appreciate enough what blunderman1 has achieved.

Here is [part one of the Chess Life bughouse articles](https://uscf1-nyc1.aodhosting.com/CL-AND-CR-ALL/CL-ALL/2003/2003_03.pdf#page=37) of WIM Dr. Alexey Root and Eric Wiggins, better known as GhostShell. Thanks, Alexey and Eric! And here are parts [two](https://uscf1-nyc1.aodhosting.com/CL-AND-CR-ALL/CL-ALL/2003/2003_05.pdf#page=39) and [three](https://uscf1-nyc1.aodhosting.com/CL-AND-CR-ALL/CL-ALL/2003/2003_09.pdf#page=27).

This variant is probably the most popular one played by club and tournament players all over the world. You can watch several top GMs playing it on [John Brezina's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@chessvideosbyjohnbrezina5947/search?query=bughouse)
